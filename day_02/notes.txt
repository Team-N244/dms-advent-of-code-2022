These are the possible choices:
A = Opponent Playing Rock
B = Opponent Playing Paper
C = Opponent Playing Scissors

X = You Play Rock     (1pt)
Y = You Play Paper    (2pts)
Z = You Play Scissors (3pts)

A X -> 1pt + 3pt (draw)
A Y -> 2pt + 6pt (win)
A Z -> 3pt + 0pt (loss)

B X -> 1pt + 0pt (loss)
B Y -> 2pt + 3pt (draw)
B Z -> 3pt + 6pt (win)

C X -> 1pt + 6pt (win)
C Y -> 2pt + 0pt (lose)
C Z -> 3pt + 3pt (draw)


Now for Part 2:

A X -> Opponent plays Rock, You need to lose (play Scissors for 3pts)
A Y -> Opponent plays Rock, You need to draw (play Rock for 4pts)
A Z -> Opponent plays Rock, You need to win  (play Paper for 8pts)

B X -> Opponent plays Paper, You need to lose (play Rock for 1pt)
B Y -> Opponent plays Paper, You need to draw (play Paper for 5pts)
B Z -> Opponent plays Paper, You need to win  (play Scissors for 9pts)

C X -> Opponent plays Scissors, you need to lose (play Paper for 2pts)
C Y -> Opponent plays Scissors, you need to draw (play Scissors for 6pts)
C Z -> Opponent plays Scissors, you need to win  (play Rock for 7pts)
